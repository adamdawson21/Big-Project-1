# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a simple game of Rock Paper Scissors. It was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## How To Play

The user has three options to chose from: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

Rock beats scissors. Scissors beats paper. Paper beats rock.

Each round, the user and the computer will choose one of the three options. The winner of the round will earn a point.

The game ends when either you or the computer reaches a score of 3.

### What I Missed

I would have liked to incorporate animated hands to show the user input after each round. I also would of liked to incorporate an API.
